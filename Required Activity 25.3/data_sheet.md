# Model Datasheet

## Motivation
With now a greater concern of optimising revenue and profit in banks, the study of customer churn prediction is vital in the operations for the banking industry. Stakeholders find this crucial for decision making given the lower cost of retaining rather than acquiring new customers. his is the metric that determines the success or failure of a business. Successful customer retention is also known to increase the customerâ€™s average lifetime value, making all future sales more valuable and improving unit margins.

The following project focuses on achieving a few key goals of building a prediction model, including:
1. Classification the churn status of bank customers.
2. Attaching a probability of churn for bank customers.
3. Selection of the best model performance used to fit our training dataset of bank customers, using the techniques of Logistic, SVM and Random Forest Classifier.

The following dataset was sourced from:  
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adammaus/predicting-churn-for-bank-customers

We note that there was no mention of the entity the dataset was sourced and funded from, as well as the team that created it.
 
## Composition
The following dataset consists of attributes coming people and documents. We note that the attributes in the data consists of bank related confidential individual information coming from work documents, such as:
1. 1 categorial output, ie. Exited Indicator of Customer
2. 4 categorial attributes, ie. Geography, Gender, a Credit Card Owned Indicator, as well as the Active Status of the Customer.
3. 8 continuous attributes, ie. Customer ID, Surname, Credit Score, Age, Tenure with the Bank, Bank Balance, Number of Bank Products, as well as the estimated salary.

We note that there are no missing values in the dataset, out of the 10,000 observations we have.  

## Collection process
We note that there was no mention of the data acuquired, sampling strategy as well as the time frame for collection. However, based on the fact that no missing values were found in the observations, it is likely that preprocessing and cleaning of the data might be done before publicly distributed.

## Preprocessing/cleaning/labelling
We note that there was no mention of the processing techniques used for the data, composition of the processing techniques used, as well as the source of the original dataset used.  
 
## Uses
We note that the folowwing data set could be used for other purposes other than predicting their churned status. This includes:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis of Salary with Bank Balances of Individuals.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis of Credit Score with Bank Products Owned.

There are some issues with using the dataset, which likely results in unfair practices from the intepretation of the results. This dataset should not be used for predicting cases out of the coverage of the customer base, ie. out of Spain, France and Germany, which might lead to a skewed model prediciton and performance. 

## Distribution
We note that there was no mention of the distribution workflow of the dataset, and the copyright information of the dataset, except for the fact that it is currently on Kaggle.

## Maintenance
We note that there was no mention of the maintanence of the dataset. It can be assumed that this dataset was uploaded as an ad hoc basis, and that the dataset was not maintained after the time of the upload.
